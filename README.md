# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Derek Lam, a frontend developer passionate for creating awesome user experiences. My main goal is to be able to build for others and make an impact with what I create. As a recent grad, I spent the majority of the last 6 months of post-grad trying to learn as much as I could with frontend development. I had previous, rudimentary knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, and React back in college, and was left with plenty of knowledge gaps to fill. Throughout the past 6 months, I've reinforced the basics of HTML, CSS, and ReactJS, and picked up new technologies along the way like using SASS as a preprocessor for CSS and NextJS as a framework for React. I've learned to give more structure to my projects, both at a file-system level and at the application level with both logic and component abstractions. I've learned more about web performance and accessibility. I've learned that I have the motivation to continue this path as a frontend dev.

Though I've thoroughly enjoyed the process of learning and building out projects of my own, after a reflection of this half-year, have come to understand that I'm still in the dark about a lot of topics. I haven't gone through vanilla JavaScript thoroughly enough. I haven't learned about the different levels of testing. I haven't truly understood the work of module bundlers like Webpack. My main goal with these 100 days is to continue to learn as a developer, through finding a balance of watching tutorials/reading documentation and building out projects that can make some sort of impact. I want to document this process and hold myself accountable. Also, a nice bonus would be to land my first frontend dev job out of school.
