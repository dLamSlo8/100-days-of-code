## Learning Log
### CSS Demystified
#### Overlooked Fundamentals III: The Cascade
Today I learned about the cascade in CSS, a concept that I had somehow missed when learning CSS to begin with, which is literally an algorithm that decides what declarations (i.e. property-value pairs) to use for each element. There are three criteria, and when each criteria is equal it moves on to the next. The three criteria are:
1. Origin and importance - Where the CSS is actually defined and how important it is (via !important)
2. Specificity - How specific a particular ruleset is (calculated via its combined selectors. [https://specificity.keegan.st/](Specificity calculator for reference))
3. Order of appearance - Literally where it appears in your CSS file(s).
I think I kind of had this knowledge in the back of my head just by writing a lot of CSS, but never formalized it. It's nice to know now exactly what is happening.

I also learned about the idea of **'flat specificity'** where we enforce only one level of specificity, usually through single class-names, so we don't have to worry about specificity conflicts. This is the primary way of writing, for instance, BEM CSS, where only single-class selectors are used, and the idea of nesting is instead an extended version of the class selector (i.e. .block__element, rather than .block .element or .block > .element). Kevin Powell, in this course, explains that perhaps we should be using specificity to our advantage and avoid these 'training wheels' of flat specificity. He has yet to go over specifics, but I'm curious as to why he believes so b/c using the BEM methodology and now using TailwindCSS has made it easier to reason about my styles b/c of flat specificity. 

**Edit**: Now that I think about it, TailwindCSS doesn't really use the flat specificity concept. I think for the most part it *does* fit, b/c we have all these utility classes that are one-off, however, you can still customize however you want, and there's even tailwind classes that use nesting, so really, it's not strict in that regard.
## Project Work
### Data Structure Visualizer
Today for this project I managed to migrate D3 to React rendering for a particular feature in our web app. This involved switching the source of truth for our positioning information in regards to displaying our data structure. It also required refactoring in that the structure of data we're receiving is different now with this different source of truth (i.e. switch from D3 data representation to our own built-in data structure.)
### Furniture Site
Today I worked on the Figma mockups for this site. I completed the landing page design and moving on to the store design next!
