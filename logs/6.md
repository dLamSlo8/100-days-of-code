# Day 6 - January 10th, 2021
## Project Work
### Data Structure Visualizer
Today was another short day, but still got some work in. I mainly met with my team to discuss refactoring further and can now move forward after finalizing more details. I built a test page for my team to work on and visualize their changes.
