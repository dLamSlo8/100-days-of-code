## Learning Log
### CSS Demystified
Today I worked up to the **Overlooked Fundamentals 2: Inheritance** Section. Here's some takeaways:
#### Overlooked Fundamentals 1: Box-sizing
One interesting thing I learned about box-sizing is that it only applies when the width is set to something other than auto. So even with block elements having a default width of auto == 100%, box-sizing wouldn't make it such that padding and border overflows the container. If we, however, set the width even to 100%, the same width as auto, it will now be overflowed.
#### Overlooked Fundamentals 2: Inheritance
With this section, I learned a bit more on what CSS properties are inherited and what aren't. The general rule of thumb is that any properties relating to typography (e.g. text-align, font-size, color, etc.) are inherited, and any properties relating to layout (i.e. position, width, height, margin, padding) are not. However, any **browser defaults** will **ignore inherited values**. This includes **font-size** for **headings** or **color** for **links**. Also basically every form element ignores inheritance. This is why in normalize.css, they actually explicitly set font-family for these elements to be inherit. General takeaway is that we should **always take advantage of inheritance to write less code**
### JS - Understanding the Weird Parts
#### Types and Operators
Today I watched until the Operator Precedence and Associativity section. I just got a good refresher on primitive types, including one that I didn't know about, Symbols.
## Project Work
### Data Structure Visualizer
Today, I successfully migrated D3 to React for tree traversal. Just need to work on animation for it, and continue to migrate other data structures. With this migration, I learned more of the distinction between D3 DOM manipulation and React rendering. D3 uses imperative rendering where we specify exactly which elements should appear, change, etc, in a particular order to draw our data structures. ReactJS, however, is inherently declarative b/c we are less hands-on with the DOM and more about specifying the UI that should appear based on the state. We're letting the program figure things out as we set up the parameters to render to the screen.
