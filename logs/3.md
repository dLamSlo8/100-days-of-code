## Learning Log
### CSS Demystified
#### Overlooked Fundamentals: Box Model
With this section, I only went through the first 2 lessons as I took a detour to the bonus material for 'Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Sizing'. But essentially here, I got a refresher on box-sizing: border-box and how it allows for more expected behaviors with set widths and heights.
#### Bonus: Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Sizing
This was a really insightful section regarding how elements are sized. I learned that intrinsic sizing is when size is based on content rather than external factors, and extrinsic sizing is the opposite. When we deal with default block elements, we know that their width is extrinsically sized, while with default inline elements, they are intrinsically sized by definition. 

It's definitely nice to be able to label these sizing behaviors. When an element is positioned absolute or fixed, I now understand that their width is intrinsically set, and that's why we need those inset values / specific width to get this element to look how we want it to.

Also with intrinsic setting, we have property values that allow us to specify how we want intrinsic sizing to work: min-content, max-content, fit-content. With min-content, we are ensuring that we have the width of the lowest-sized child, and the opposite for max. Fit-content is a nice in-between that essentially clamps an element's maximum size (taking into account overflow) and the minimum content.
### JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
Today I watched up to lesson 10 of Section 2: Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments. My main motivation with this course is just to deepen my understanding of JavaScript. To be honest, I think I have a very surface level understanding, involving basic constructs and es6 features, with some working knowledge of more advanced topics like closures. Other than that, I'm just kind of in the dark in terms of other JS concepts like hoisting or even truly understanding 'this'. I kind of messed up post-grad by jumping straight into React again rather than try to refresh JS. Granted, while working with React, I still refreshed a bit of JS knowledge. But now, I'm just trying to remedy these knowledge gaps and learn all that I can.

In terms of what I learned today, I learned about the global execution context that is created whenever JS code is run. I think I knew of it, but definitely couldn't name it.
### Project Work: Data Structure Visualizer
Today I worked on adding the swapping animation for nodes when it comes to BST delete. It will also be useful for our heap feature. It is kind of hacky and honestly might prompt some heavy duty refactoring. Basically the issue is that we're trying to get particular nodes in our visualization to animate, but they've been pre-drawn using D3 DOM manipulation and data-binding methods. I'm considering refactoring the code such that React will handle the DOM manipulation (as it normally should), and D3 will purely be used for the layouts and positioning information it provides. This way, we can more readily access the components we need to animate. This will of course require more thought, especially for animation, but just some opening thoughts for now. 

Definitely should have done more technical planning before venturing off on creating the animation system. **That's a lesson I'll keep.**

I also worked on being able to turn tree traversal animations off and just print out the output. Turned out great! **Still wondering whether or not the user should have to manually press a button to generate the traversal output, or if it should automatically update on tree change or traversal type change.**
