# Day 5 - January 9th, 2021
## Project Work
### Data Structure Visualizer
Today I continued the refactor I mentioned yesterday. We had another team meet for more requirements and I came out feeling more confident in what we were working on.
### New Project Work
Today I got an offer to help out a family friend on an e-commerce site for their company. It will be my first time using Squarespace and using a CMS in general, so it's nice to gain that knowledge. I'm currently working on Figma mockups!
