## Project Work - Data Structure Visualizer
First off, I'll briefly introduce the project I've been working on for about a month with 2 other developers. We're building out a project called Data Structure Visualizer (name WIP), which is a web app that aims to help visualize data structures and algorithms. Our main goal with the user experience is to make the content approachable and intuitive, catering to anybody who wants to reinforce their knowledge of these particular DSA's, at any skill level. It's built using NextJS, TailwindCSS, D3.js, and React-spring for animations.

### Animation Log Feature
Today, I worked on building out the animation log feature. This is a key component to help understanding of what these algorithms are actually doing. Every step in the animation is associated with a string representation (i.e. the log), and the log gets updated appropriately based on the current state of the animation.

#### Requirements
* Ensure the animation log is in sync with the current state of the animation, whether in auto-play mode or not.
* After every step, a string is added to the animation log.
* A step can never be taken away from the animation log. It only moves forward such that we can access previous steps once we've reached them.

#### Issues
My main issues came from working with both manual and auto controls. I needed a way to keep track of where I was currently in the log while the active step is constantly changing based on user input. The fix came from just adding one piece of state such that now there are essentially two markers for an animation's progress: one for the active step and one for the last step in the log. Once they are equal, we can move the log forward.

## Learning Log
I'm going to start a learning log where I keep track of what I'm learning from the courses I'm currently interested in. Right now, that happens to be Kevin Powell's CSS Demystified and Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts!
