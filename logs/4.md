## Learning Log
### Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts
Today I'm finishing the Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments.

**Takeaways:**
#### TL;DR
Today I basically learned about execution contexts, gained a better understanding of scope, and briefly learned about the event queue/loop in JS. I learned about the global execution context as well as the execution contexts that are created on function invocation, how contexts are created via the 2-phase process, and how variables that exist in a particular context are available to contexts that are part of the same lexical environment of the current context. This is done via scope chaining, the primary method of JS variable/function lookup. In terms of the event loop, I learned that JS is still ultimately a single-threaded language despite asynchronous callbacks existing, b/c JS handles these callbacks synchronously through the order of the event queue after the execution stack is empty (i.e. code has finished executing and all functions have returned)

#### Running JS file + Creation of Global Execution Context
I learned that when JS is run, syntax parsing happens first, then global execution context is created.
I learned that the global execution context, created whenever JS is run, is created in two phases:
1. Creation Phase: Global object + 'this' + link to outer environment is created -> hoisting is done. Hoisting refers to the act of setting up the memory
for all variables and functions defined in our JS file. It DOESN'T mean putting all declarations at the top, though that may seem the case. It sets up
variables as undefined and functions with all their lines of code. That is why we can call on functions and access variables (though they will always be undefined to begin with) prior to their declarations. 
2. Execution Phase: Code is interpreted and executed line-by-line.

I learned that these phases also apply to ANY execution context, with the caveat that a global object is not created besides anything besides the global execution context. 'this', however, is created.
#### Execution Stack
I learned that JS has an execution stack, which is literally a stack of execution contexts, and whenever a function is invoked, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the stack. That's when it again, goes through 2 phases, then gets popped off after finishing execution.
I learned that every execution context has a variable environment, its local scope, containing the variables and functions that are defined within that scope. 
#### Scope Chain
Whenever we want to do a lookup for a variable or function, we always check the local variable environment, then go up the chain of outer environments until we reach the global environment. This is our **scope chain**
How we decide an outer environment is based on where the current function is located lexically in the code. Any top-level function's outer environment is the global environment.
#### The Event Queue
JS is a singled-threaded, synchronous language. When dealing with asynchronous callbacks (functions that are 'called back' when some other async event happens), all events are pushed onto the event queue, and only when JS' execution stack is empty will it check the event queue to invoke such callbacks.

## Project Work
### Data Structure Visualizer
Today I met with my other team members and we've decided to do some critical refactoring, so I spent some time doing technical planning for part of this refactor, thinking about my own requirements as well as what I'd need from the team. We're going to meet tomorrow to discuss more. We're essentially implementing what I talked about in yesterday's log regarding React handling rendering the visualization components. Now, we've also decided to drop D3 as the positioning information didn't end up fitting our specific needs. I still will take this as a lesson to just **plan ahead to the best of my ability**. I should have taken into account the animation troubles that I could run into with using two different rendering paradigms.
