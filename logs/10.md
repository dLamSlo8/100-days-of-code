# Day 10 - January 14th, 2021
## Project Work
### Data Structure Visualizer
Today I started working on migrating D3 for the binary search tree data structure. I also helped set up some testing for the other developers to ensure that their methods resulted in the proper visual display on the frontend. Not too much done today as I'm trying to prep for behavioral interviews currently!
