## Learning Log
### CSS Demystified
#### Putting it into practice
This section was after the cascade algorithm section. Here I mainly learned of a different flavor of BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology. Essentially, instead of elements having modifiers, we can just have selectors with block modifiers  nesting into elements to style an element in a particular way. This takes advantage of the cascade while allowing for more DRY code as we don't have to repeat the same modifiers for every block's elements. 
## General Updates
Today I got an email to start the interview process for a company. Going to be doing some research and preparing for it!
