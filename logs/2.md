## Learning Log
### CSS Demystified
I am taking this course to help reinforce my current working knowledge of CSS and expand on it b/c there's still so much I don't know.
#### Introduction Section
I learned that there's a Firefox Developer edition with more up-to-date DevTools specifically for CSS, and for this course specifically, and possible in the future, I'll use this browser for development.
#### Understanding CSS
I learned some valuable insight on why CSS is such a weird language. Probably the most important takeaway is that CSS is really for creating the intent of how we want a document to look, although it might not be the final result, as ultimately the client is in control of the outcome, based on user device, user settings, browser defaults, etc. We are building to account for some of those control factors and providing an idealized look at the document such that whatever browser the user is running has enough meaningful information to render the page appropriately.

So overall, it's important to work with CSS how it's intended, as it's built for the web whose main goal is to be universal & platform-agnostic.
### Firefox Bug
I learned that padding bottom doesn't work correctly when in a container with overflow.
## Project Work - Data Structure Visualizer
Today I completed the animation log component with its current requirements. This required adding the 'jump to any step' functionality. Then I did some bug fixing where our animations, in a reduced-motion mode, wouldn't actually reduce motion. Lastly, I began brainstorming ideas for our tree traversal algorithms on how we want steps to be displayed in the animation log.
